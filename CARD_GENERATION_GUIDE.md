# Card Generation Guide for ChoiceCore Games

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for Large Language Models (LLMs) and developers to create cards for ChoiceCore games. While focused on the Eltern Simulator example, these principles apply to any narrative choice game.

## ChoiceCore Engine Overview

**ChoiceCore** is a minimalist game engine for narrative games with binary choices, inspired by Reigns. The engine features:
- üéÆ Modern responsive UI with vertical power bars
- üñ±Ô∏è Hover preview system showing power changes
- üìñ Complex story sequencing with dependencies
- üéØ Customizable power systems and game rules
- üì± Cross-device compatibility

## Featured Game: Eltern Simulator

**Eltern Simulator** is a German parenting simulation where players navigate parenting challenges through binary choices affecting four power systems.

## Power System (Resources)

The game tracks four powers that must stay within bounds (0-100 for most, 0-500 for money):

### üí∞ **geld** (Money: 0-500)
- Represents family financial resources
- Lost through: purchases, medical expenses, activities, gifts, missed work
- Gained through: saving money, avoiding expenses, working extra, smart financial choices

### üòä **kinder_glueck** (Kids Happiness: 0-100)  
- Represents how happy and satisfied the children are
- Increased by: fun activities, getting desires fulfilled, quality time, freedom
- Decreased by: restrictions, disappointments, conflicts, unfairness

### üß† **eltern_nerven** (Parent Nerves/Mental Health: 0-100)
- Represents parent stress and mental well-being
- Decreased by: difficult situations, time pressure, conflicts, constant demands
- Increased by: successful resolutions, getting help, rest, cooperation

### ‚ù§Ô∏è **kinder_gesundheit** (Kids Health: 0-100)
- Represents physical and mental health of children
- Increased by: good choices, exercise, proper care, safety, nutrition
- Decreased by: risky behavior, poor choices, neglect, unsafe situations

## Advanced Features

### Story Sequences
The engine supports complex narrative arcs through story sequences:
- **Story Cards**: Special cards that appear in predetermined order
- **Trigger Conditions**: Stories activate based on card count or story completion
- **Dependencies**: Stories can require other stories to complete first
- **Insertion Windows**: Stories inject cards within configurable ranges

### Hover Preview System
- **Real-time Feedback**: Players see exact power changes before choosing
- **Color Coding**: Green for positive effects, red for negative effects
- **Effect Parsing**: Supports both "+15" and "15" format in YAML

### Responsive Design
- **Vertical Power Bars**: Space-efficient layout eliminating scrolling
- **Mobile-First**: Works seamlessly across all device sizes
- **Modern Styling**: Gradient backgrounds and smooth animations

## Card Structure (YAML Format)

Every card must follow this exact structure:

```yaml
id: unique_card_name
image: assets/images/placeholder.svg
description: "The scenario description in target language with quotation marks."
left:
  label: "Left choice description"
  effects:
    - power_name: +/-amount
    - power_name: +/-amount
right:
  label: "Right choice description"
  effects:
    - power_name: +/-amount
    - power_name: +/-amount
```

### Advanced Card Features

```yaml
id: advanced_card
image: assets/images/placeholder.svg
description: "Scenario description."
left:
  label: "Choice A"
  effects:
    - geld: -50
    - kinder_glueck: +20
  follow_up: next_card_id  # Trigger specific next card
  booster: power_boost_id  # Apply temporary booster
right:
  label: "Choice B"
  effects:
    - eltern_nerven: -15
    - kinder_gesundheit: +10
```

## Story Structure (YAML Format)

### Probabilistic Stories (Recommended)

Stories create dynamic narrative experiences with probabilistic card mixing:

```yaml
id: story_name
trigger:
  after_cards: 10                      # Trigger after N regular cards
  requires_story_completed: [story_a]  # Require other stories first
cards:
  - id: story_card_1
    probability: 0.75                  # 75% chance to appear
    mix_in_next: 15                    # Mix into next 15 cards
  - id: story_card_2
    probability: 0.50                  # 50% chance to appear
    mix_in_next: 20                    # Mix into next 20 cards
  - id: rare_event_card
    probability: 0.25                  # 25% chance (rare event)
    mix_in_next: 30                    # Mix into next 30 cards
```

### Legacy Sequential Stories (Backward Compatible)

```yaml
id: story_name
cards: [card1_id, card2_id, card3_id]  # Sequence of story cards
trigger:
  after_cards: 5                       # Trigger after N regular cards
  requires_story_completed: [story_a]  # Require other stories first
insert_window: 3                       # Inject within next 3 draws
```

### Probabilistic Story System Benefits

The new probabilistic system provides:

- **üé≤ Replayability**: Each playthrough has different story experiences
- **üéØ Realistic Frequency**: Common events (85%) vs rare events (25%)
- **üìç Dynamic Positioning**: Cards appear at random positions within specified ranges
- **‚öñÔ∏è Balanced Gameplay**: Not all story cards appear every time
- **üîÑ Varied Experiences**: Multiple playthroughs feel unique and fresh

**Probability Guidelines:**
- **Very Common (80-90%)**: Daily parenting situations (morning chaos, meal times)
- **Common (60-75%)**: Regular challenges (homework, bedtime, shopping requests)
- **Moderate (40-60%)**: Occasional issues (illness, social conflicts, special events)
- **Uncommon (25-40%)**: Challenging situations (behavior problems, accidents)
- **Rare (10-25%)**: Lucky breaks, unexpected positive events, major incidents

**Mix Range Guidelines:**
- **Early Game (8-15 cards)**: Immediate story continuation
- **Short Term (15-20 cards)**: Story elements within current session
- **Medium Term (20-30 cards)**: Story threads across multiple sessions
- **Long Term (30+ cards)**: Rare callbacks and long-term consequences

## Important Rules

### 1. **ID Naming**
- Use lowercase letters and underscores only
- Make it descriptive: `schulzeugnis_schlecht`, `geburtstag_planung`
- Must be unique across all cards and stories
- Consider namespace for story cards: `story_name_card1`

### 2. **Image Paths**
- Use relative paths: `assets/images/placeholder.svg`
- Consistent with game's asset structure
- Plan for future image implementation

### 3. **Description Writing**
- Must be in target language (German for Eltern Simulator)
- Use quotation marks around entire description
- 1-3 sentences describing the scenario
- Create engaging, relatable situations
- Avoid exposition; focus on immediate choice

### 4. **Choice Labels**
- Concise (max 6-8 words)
- Present clear alternatives
- Use target language consistently
- Make consequences somewhat predictable
- Create meaningful dilemmas

### 5. **Effects Balance**
- **Every choice must affect at least 2 powers**
- Total effect magnitude should be 20-60 points across all powers
- Create meaningful trade-offs between choices
- **Money Effects:**
  - Expensive choices: -50 to -300 geld
  - Normal purchases: -10 to -50 geld
  - Major financial impact: -100 to -200 geld
- **Other Powers:**
  - Small impacts: +/-5 to +/-15
  - Medium impacts: +/-20 to +/-30
  - Large impacts: +/-40 to +/-50
- **Balance Principle**: High cost should provide significant benefit

### 6. **Realistic Scenarios for Parenting Game**
Focus on authentic parenting situations:
- **Daily Routines**: Morning stress, bedtime, meals, chores
- **School Issues**: Grades, homework, bullying, teacher conflicts
- **Social Dynamics**: Peer pressure, friendships, social media
- **Technology**: Screen time, device limits, online safety
- **Financial Decisions**: Allowance, purchases, expensive activities
- **Health & Safety**: Medical decisions, risk assessment, accidents
- **Family Relationships**: Sibling conflicts, quality time, discipline
- **Development**: Independence, responsibility, life skills

## Advanced Game Design Concepts

### Story Arc Planning
When designing story sequences:

1. **Introduction**: Set up the narrative scenario
2. **Development**: Build tension and complexity
3. **Resolution**: Provide satisfying conclusion
4. **Consequences**: Show long-term effects

Example story progression:
```
Story: "Pet Snake Adventure"
1. schlange_wunsch (child wants pet snake)
2. schlangen_begegnung (encounter with actual snake)
3. [Possible future]: schlange_verantwortung (learning responsibility)
```

### Power Interaction Design
Create cards where powers interact meaningfully:
- **Money vs. Happiness**: Expensive choices that increase joy
- **Health vs. Freedom**: Safety restrictions vs. child autonomy
- **Parent Stress vs. Child Satisfaction**: Difficult but rewarding choices
- **Short-term vs. Long-term**: Immediate gratification vs. future benefits

### Difficulty Progression
Consider player progression through card design:
- **Early cards**: Simpler choices, lower stakes
- **Mid-game**: More complex dilemmas, higher impact
- **Advanced**: Multiple interconnected consequences

## What NOT to Do

‚ùå **Avoid these critical mistakes:**

### Content Issues
1. **Unrealistic scenarios**: Fantasy elements, impossible situations
2. **Extreme situations**: Life-threatening emergencies, serious trauma, abuse
3. **Adult-only content**: Sexual content, violence, substance abuse
